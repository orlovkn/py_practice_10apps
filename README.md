## Data Analysis with Pandas

[Link to the course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/)

### Instructions
Make sure you have pandas installed. You can install it with pip:

```
pip install pandas
```

Also, in the next lecture, we will use an enhanced Python interactive shell called IPython.

IPython is just like the normal shell you get when you run python, but IPython provides better printing for large text. This ability makes IPython suitable for data analysis because the program prints data in a well-structured format. You can install IPython with pip:

```
pip install ipython 
```
